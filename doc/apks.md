## APKs

At two points during this project you're asked to hand in an APK file, so teachers and fellow students can run your game. You should do that by building the APK, and copying it from `app/buikd/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` to the `doc` directory, giving it the right filename. Then, commit and push to GitLab.

- [Prototype](prototype.apk). Start of week 3, individual.
- [Sprint 2](sprint2.apk). Start of week 8, group. We'll download this file on Friday morning of week 8, and make it available to all attendees of the App Show. So you can still release hot-fixes after the deadline Monday 14:00, but they won't be considered during grading.
