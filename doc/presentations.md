## Presentations

During this course five video presentations are to be handed in. (Two individual presentations, three group presentations.)

Put the files for these videos in the `doc/` directory and make sure they are properly linked from this Markdown file. Then, commit the file and push to GitLab. (Clicking links won't work in Android Studio, but it should work in the GitLab web interface.)
